        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            "Naalukettu" revolves around the life of Appunni, a young boy who belongs to a once-prosperous but now declining Nair family. The novel is set in a traditional matrilineal household, the Naalukettu, where Appunni's experiences of growing up in a fragmented family form the crux of the narrative. His father dies when he is very young, and his mother, a widow, faces social alienation and economic hardship, deeply affecting Appunni's childhood and shaping his view of the world.

        <p>
            As Appunni grows up, he is torn between the memories of his father's noble past and the harsh realities of his present life, marked by poverty and humiliation. His mother struggles to provide for him, while the family's once-magnificent house, the Naalukettu, symbolically decays along with their fortunes. This physical and emotional decline of the Naalukettu reflects the broader collapse of traditional values and social structures in Kerala at the time.

        <p>
            Throughout the novel, Appunni harbors a deep-seated resentment towards his relatives, particularly his uncle, who represents the oppressive forces within the family. His struggle is not only against external adversities but also against the internal conflicts of pride, anger, and the longing for revenge. As he matures, Appunni begins to understand the futility of his bitterness and the need for reconciliation with his past, leading to a nuanced exploration of human emotions and familial bonds.

        <p>
            In "Naalukettu," M. T. Vasudevan Nair masterfully captures the transformation of Kerala's social fabric through the eyes of a vulnerable and sensitive protagonist. The novel is both a personal coming-of-age story and a broader commentary on the decline of the matrilineal system and the accompanying shifts in values and relationships within the community. The poignant narrative, rich in cultural and emotional detail, has made "Naalukettu" a timeless work in Malayalam literature.
