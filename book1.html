        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            "Oru Sankeerthanam Pole" is a profound exploration of love, art, and human connection, set against the backdrop of 19th-century Russia. The novel is a fictionalized account of a pivotal period in the life of the great Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. Perumbadavam Sreedharan masterfully weaves a narrative that captures Dostoevsky's struggles, particularly during the writing of his classic novel, "The Gambler." The novel delves into Dostoevsky's relationship with his stenographer, Anna Grigoryevna, who later becomes his wife. This relationship is central to the story, as it explores the transformative power of love and companionship

            The novel opens with Dostoevsky grappling with a crippling gambling addiction and the looming pressure of deadlines imposed by his publishers. His financial troubles and deteriorating health add to the tension, creating a sense of urgency and despair. Amidst this turmoil, Anna enters his life as a stenographer hired to help him complete "The Gambler" within a stringent deadline. Their interactions are initially formal, but as they spend more time together, a deeper connection begins to form.

            As the narrative progresses, Sreedharan delves into the psychological and emotional landscape of Dostoevsky. The author paints a vivid picture of a man tormented by his past, his insecurities, and his desperate need for redemption. Anna's presence, with her unwavering support and understanding, becomes a beacon of hope for Dostoevsky. Through their conversations and shared experiences, Anna helps Dostoevsky confront his inner demons and find the strength to continue his work. The novel beautifully portrays how their growing bond becomes a source of healing and inspiration for Dostoevsky.

            "Oru Sankeerthanam Pole" is not just a love story but also a meditation on the creative process and the burdens that come with genius. Sreedharan's portrayal of Dostoevsky is deeply empathetic, capturing the complexities of his character with nuance and sensitivity. The novel's title, which translates to "Like a Psalm," reflects the lyrical and introspective nature of the narrative. It is a tribute to the redemptive power of love and the profound impact one person can have on another's life. Through its rich storytelling and deep emotional resonance, "Oru Sankeerthanam Pole" has earned its place as one of the most cherished works in Malayalam literature.
