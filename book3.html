        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            "Pride and Prejudice" is set in early 19th-century England and centers around the lives of the Bennet family, particularly the five Bennet sisters—Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia. The novel opens with the arrival of the wealthy and eligible bachelor Mr. Charles Bingley in the neighborhood, causing much excitement among the Bennets and their social circle. Bingley quickly forms an attachment to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, while his close friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, initially alienates the local society with his aloof and proud demeanor

            Elizabeth Bennet, the novel's protagonist, is intelligent, witty, and independent-minded, making her stand out among her sisters. She forms a strong dislike for Mr. Darcy due to his haughty behavior and because of a misunderstanding involving Mr. George Wickham, a charming militia officer who shares a negative story about Darcy's past. Elizabeth's prejudice against Darcy grows, especially after he intervenes to separate Jane and Bingley, believing Jane to be indifferent to Bingley and concerned about her family's lower social standing.

            As the story progresses, Elizabeth unexpectedly receives a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, who confesses his love for her despite her family's lower status. Shocked by his proposal and his role in separating Jane and Bingley, Elizabeth rejects him. Darcy, in turn, writes her a letter explaining his actions, revealing that Wickham is not as honorable as he seems, and that his interference with Jane and Bingley was motivated by concern for his friend's happiness. Elizabeth begins to reassess her feelings and prejudices, realizing that she may have misjudged Darcy.

            Eventually, the misunderstandings between Elizabeth and Darcy are cleared up, and they come to appreciate each other's true character. Darcy's actions—most notably, his efforts to resolve the scandal caused by Lydia Bennet's elopement with Wickham—demonstrate his genuine love and respect for Elizabeth. In the end, Darcy proposes to Elizabeth again, and this time, she accepts. The novel concludes with the marriages of Elizabeth to Darcy and Jane to Bingley, highlighting themes of love, social class, and the dangers of pride and prejudice.
